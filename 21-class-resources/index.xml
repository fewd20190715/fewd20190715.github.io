      <description>Referencing documentation is a core task for developers.
 Documentation communicates how something (in our case programming languages, software libraries) works.
 Good documentation reduces implementation time and increases predictability of our software programs.
  We will be referring to the following list of the documentation resources frequently throughout the course:
HTML MDN&amp;rsquo;s HTML Reference
CSS MDN&amp;rsquo;s CSS Reference
Javascript MDN&amp;rsquo;s Javascript Reference
jQuery jQuery Documentation</description>

      <title>Wireframes to HTML</title>
      <link>/21-class-resources/wireframes-to-html/</link>

      <description>Why Wireframes? Wireframes are meant to help you plan the overall structure (layout of your pages)
See this article for a good overview of wireframes: https://balsamiq.com/learn/resources/articles/what-are-wireframes/
What happens after the wireframes? The next step after creating your wireframes is to convert the wireframes into HTML (using minimal css to create high level box containers).
After that is done, you can then proceed to add your content and CSS styling.</description>
