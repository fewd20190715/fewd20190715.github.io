	"content": " Before you start Step 1: Ensure you have a github folder Ensure that you have a folder named gitHub in the FEWD folder . You will be using this folder to manage all of your work that lives in Github through the course. This folder only needs to be created once.\nStep 2: Log into to your Github account Ensure you are logged into your GitHub account on Github.com\nStep 3: Log into your Github Desktop application Ensure You have installed the Github Desktop Application on your computer and you have logged in the application using your GitHub username and password\nForking the Assignment Repository Step 4: Navigate to the HW Repository on Github.com The instructor will provide you with a link to the repository that houses the HW assignment on Github.com. Click on that link and you should be navigated to the repository page for the assignment located on Github.com.\nStep 5: Fork the HW Repository to create a copy under your account Next we will fork the repository that contains the homework assignment. Remember, forking a repository copies a repository and places it under your account.\nFork the repository by pressing the Fork button in the upper right hand corner:\nIf you have more than one Github account associated with your email address, you will be asked to pick one. I recommended that you select the account associated with your personal account (this is most likely listed first in the list).\n Step 6: Confirm fork was successful Confirm that the fork was successful by observing that a copy of the repository has been placed under your account.\nIn the example above, the github account named kareemgrant successfully forked (i.e. copied) the HW assignment repository (sample-hw-assignment) that is owned by an account named fewd20190318\nCloning the forked repository Congrats! You have forked the HW assignment repository to your account. However, you\u0026rsquo;re still not able to work on it, since the forked repository lives in the cloud on Github (another way to say this is that your repository is a remote repository) and you need a copy of the repository on your computer so you can work on it.\n The process of creating a local copy (i.e. on your computer) of a remote repository is called cloning. Cloning also allows both local and remote copies of a repository to stay in sync.\n We\u0026rsquo;ll be using the Github Desktop Application to clone our remote repositories. Make sure you have Github Desktop open on your computer. Also make sure you are signed in.\n  Step 7: Clone the forked repository Clone the repository by pressing on the button labeled Clone or download and then press the button labeled Open in Desktop. This action will open the Github Desktop application located on your computer.\nStep 8: Place the cloned repo into your FEWD/github folder While in Github Desktop navigate to your github folder located inside your FEWD folder (see Step 1)\nStep 9: Confirm clone was successfully placed in your FEWD/github folder On your computer, navigate to your FEWD/github folder and confirm the existences of a folder that has name that matches the name of your remote repository\nWorking on your assignment If you\u0026rsquo;ve made it this far you have successfully cloned your assignment repository and now you\u0026rsquo;re ready to start coding! Going forward, all of your work on this particular assignment will live in your FEWD/github/{name-of-your-assignment-repository} folder\nStep 10: Open the repository folder in your text editor Using Atom, open the project folder for your assignment repository (FEWD/github/{name-of-your-assignment-repository})\nYou should always open the top-level folder for your project with your text editor (Atom) and not individually project files. This will help you stay organized and help you keep your sanity.\n One way to confirm that you\u0026rsquo;ve opened the \u0026ldquo;top-level\u0026rdquo; folder of a project is to confirm that you can see only one project and all of its child files/folders in the Tree View located in the left pane. Use cmd + \\ (mac) or ctrl+\\ (pc) to toggle the Tree View\nStep 11: Work on your assignment You are going to work on your assignment the way your normally would. Ensuring that you constantly save your work (cmd+s - mac / ctrl+s - pc ) along the way.\n(Git) Commit your work While you work on your assignment it is highly recommended that you periodically Commit your code.\nCommitting is Git\u0026rsquo;s way of saving the history of the changes you\u0026rsquo;ve made on the assignment (much like the \u0026ldquo;Track Changes\u0026rdquo; feature of word processors). A commit takes a \u0026ldquo;snapshot\u0026rdquo; of your project\u0026rsquo;s entire codebase. This is extremely powerful as it allows you to \u0026ldquo;time travel\u0026rdquo; throughout your code.\nIt is a best practice to commit your code once you\u0026rsquo;ve finished a \u0026ldquo;unit\u0026rdquo; of work.\nIf you approach your assignments by breaking them up in parts or tasks, then a unit would represent that task.\nFor example: If you were tasked with building a portfolio site for a client the project could be broken into a series of small tasks such as:\n implement design layout\n add css styles\n add portfolio images\n etc\n  If you were using git, it would be a best practice to have a commit for each one of the tasks above.\nWhy? Because if something breaks and is beyond repair, you can easily revert to a past commit that you know works.\nGit requires that you submit a message with each commit. This message is used to communicate the unit of work that was done.\nStep 12: Make a commit using Github Desktop After you\u0026rsquo;ve made changes associated with a \u0026ldquo;unit\u0026rdquo; of work, you\u0026rsquo;re ready to commit.\nOpen Github Desktop and ensure that you have selected the correct project (in Github Desktop)\nAfter you commit you can go back to working on your \u0026ldquo;next unit of work\u0026rdquo; or step.\nYou aren\u0026rsquo;t required to take this approach of breaking up your assignment into tasks (or units of work) but it is highly recommended.\n (Git) Push your work to Github to keep your work synced You have been committing your code periodically and now you\u0026rsquo;d like to see your changes reflected on Github.com (i.e. the remote repository). However, after navigating to remote repository on Github.com you find that none of your recent changes are being reflected.\nThe reason you don\u0026rsquo;t see anything is because you haven\u0026rsquo;t pushed your code back up to the remote repository on Github. Pushing your code keeps your local repository and its associated remote repository in sync.\nStep 13: Push your code back to the remote repository on Github.com In Github Desktop (after you have committed all your changes) press the button labeled Push Origin to push your changes to Github.\nStep 14: Confirm your commits were successfully \u0026ldquo;pushed\u0026rdquo; back to Github.com Navigate to remote repository for the assignment on Github.com (i.e. the assignment repository that is located under your Github account).\nConfirm that the changes you made are displayed in the commit history of the remote repository.\nIn this example we see that the changes made locally (on your computers) are now reflected (aka they were synced) with the associated remote repository!\nSubmit your homework by making a Pull Request You\u0026rsquo;ve made all our commits and you\u0026rsquo;ve finished the assignment. Now you are ready to submit your homework for feedback.\nStep 15: Make a pull request  While in your repository press the link labeled Pull requests to submit your homework. See gif below for more information.\n Press the green button labeled New pull request\n You will be taken to the \u0026ldquo;Open a pull request\u0026rdquo; screen that contains some dropdowns, these dropdowns do not need to be changed.  Then press the green button labeled Create pull request\n In the title field of the pull request, name your pull request using the following format: HW Submission by [Your Full Name]\n Finally, press the green button labeled Create pull request to complete the process of submitting your homework\n  See the example below:\n"

Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project\n Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else\u0026rsquo;s project or to use someone else\u0026rsquo;s project as a starting point for your own idea\n  Clone  Copies a remote repository (i.e. repository in the cloud on a platform like Github.com) and creates a local copy of the repository on your computer\n Cloning creates a link between the the remote and local copy of a repository, allowing you to your code in sync between the two\n  Pull Request  Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository\u0026rsquo;s collaborators (i.e. team members).\n Pull requests can be thought of as a developer asking for permission to merge their changes into the master branch\n Pull requests each have their own discussion forum, where developer can discuss the changes requested and suggest further revisions.\n This discussion as also referred to as Code Reviews\n  Great resource for all things git can be found here\n "

Scalable unit that is used in web document media\n Font-size is computed relative to font-size of parent element\n Does not lock users into an absolute font-size (older browsers do not re-size text set in pixels when users zoom)\n Provides users with highest level of control over the content they are viewing\n  History: Old-fashioned metal typesetting, the em referred to the size of the metal plates that contained a raised letter, which had to be wide enough to fit the widest letter, the capital M. Many people assume that digital ems are also based on the width of the letter M, but they aren’t.\n EMs in practice  html { // set base font-size for entire site font-size: 16px; } h1 { // translates to \u0026quot;make h1 element 1.4x larger than base font size (16px)\u0026quot; // resulting in a font size of 22.4px font-size: 1.4em; } h2 { // translates to \u0026quot;make h1 element 1.3x larger than base font size (16px)\u0026quot; // resulting in a font size of 20.8px font-size: 1.3em; }  Example: EMs in action\nJS Bin on jsbin.com\nIn the example above the font-size of the .green-box element is significantly larger than the other boxes even though it has the same value for font-size: 1.4em;\nThis is due to the fact that ems are calculated relative to their parent so in the case of the .green-box element the browser will use the following calculation to determine its font-size in pixels:\n16px * 1.4 * 1.4 * 1.4 = 43.9px  Example: Using EMs for width\nJS Bin on jsbin.com\nIn the example above is set to 20em. Since the default font size of the page is set to 16px, the calculation of the width will be the following:\n16px * 20 = 320  Why use EMs?  Main reason is to effectively scale our text (and other css attributes) up and down depending on the screen size\n Click here for a great example of responsively styled text (resize your browser window to see the effect)\n  "

This means that it will be sized relative to the root element ( or ) and NOT it\u0026rsquo;s parent (.red-box element). So as a result\nThis is due to the fact that REMs are calculated relative to root element so in the case of the .green-box element the browser will use the following calculation to determine its font-size in pixels:\n16px * 1.4 = 22.4px  You don\u0026rsquo;t need to set the base font-size on the \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; element because it inherits font-size from the \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; tag by default.

Besides, if you don\u0026rsquo;t remember something just look it up (i.e. google).\n Work smarter not harder: In additional to looking things up, developers are really good at referencing past code that they\u0026rsquo;ve used in the past to solve problems they encounter in the present. So keep your past code organized so you easily reference it later. You don\u0026rsquo;t get points for memorizing anything, but you do get points for being resourceful and using past work to help you move a litter faster today.\n Ask Questions: Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions, everyone learns differently, it\u0026rsquo;s the instructor\u0026rsquo;s responsibility to ensure you grasp the concepts. Your questions helps me (your instructor) understand what\u0026rsquo;s working and what\u0026rsquo;s not.\n Change your perspective of failure: Expects things to not work.

Instead of focusing on what you think may be the \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; approach, just focus on ensuring that your program / assignments is the goals or requirements (\u0026ldquo;just get it things working first\u0026rdquo;).\n Perfection is the enemy of good enough: When you go through your homework assignments and labs your # 1 goal is to \u0026ldquo;just get things working\u0026rdquo; and not to make it perfect the first time. Get things working first (no matter how janky it may seem) and only after you\u0026rsquo;ve got it working should you go through the process developers call refactoring, optimizing the code without changing the behavior (i.e. making it look nice).\n Use names that make sense: As a developer you are going to be frequently tasked with naming things. Naming things is hard, but my advice is to be as explicit as possible. You should always write your code as if someone else is going to read it and you want them to be able to quickly understand what’s going on. One of the best ways to accomplish that is to use names that highly contextual. For example, if you have a variable that is supposed to represent a person’s first name, then be as explicit as possible:\n  // very bad - you don't get points for making names super short var n = \u0026quot;Kiara\u0026quot; // ok but not great var name = \u0026quot;Kiara\u0026quot; // best - explicit, there's no doubt what this variable should represent var firstName = \u0026quot;Kiara\u0026quot;  "

Spans  Spans are the inline equivalent to Divs\n Spans are used to either:\n contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text\n contain a number of inline elements\n  most common reason why people use  elements is so that they can control the appearance of the content of these elements using CSS\n  JS Bin on jsbin.com\nThis example uses classes and css, we will cover these topics later in the course\n "
